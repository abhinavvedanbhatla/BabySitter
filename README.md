# How to run this program if you're not using any IDE.

The Java Development Kit (JDK) can be downloaded from Oracle. The Java download tab includes links to download the JDK or the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). Follow the JDK link because clicking the JRE link gets you only the JRE, not the complete JDK.

After you install the JDK, you need to configure your OS so that it can find the JDK command line tools. Start by setting the Path environment variable — a list of folders that the OS uses to locate executable programs. To do this on a Windows XP, Windows Vista, or Windows 7 system, follow these steps:

1) Click the Windows (Start) button and then right-click Computer (Windows 7 or Vista) or My Computer (XP).
	
2) Click the Advanced tab (XP) or the Advanced System Settings link (Vista and 7); then click the Environment Variables button.

3) In the System Variables list, scroll to the Path variable, select it, and then click the Edit button.

Add the JDK bin folder to the beginning of the Path value. 
							c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0\bin;
Click OK to exit.
